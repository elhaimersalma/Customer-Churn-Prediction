# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Problem: The bank is losing customers who let their savings account balances fall below the minimum threshold, resulting in account closure and lost revenue.

Goal: Predict which customers are most likely to churn (drop below the minimum balance) before it happens, allowing the bank to intervene and retain their business.

Data available:

Customer demographics: age, gender, income, occupation, location, etc.

Transaction data: account activity such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, loan payments, etc. (frequency, amount, type, source/destination)

Account information: account age, balance history, minimum balance requirement, fees incurred, etc.

Benefits of successful churn prediction:

Reduced customer churn rate: Saving revenue and maintaining a steady customer base.

Improved customer satisfaction: Preventing negative experiences and strengthening customer loyalty.

Data-driven decision making: Allowing the bank to allocate resources effectively and focus on high-impact retention strategies.
